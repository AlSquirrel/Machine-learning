Quality prediction with voting regressor

For given data from >500 facility sensors need to prediction the cumulative parameter of facility work quality. This script demonstrates the using of voting regressor for three regressors: linear, gradient boosting and random forest regressor.
Given data in Data.csv, target in target.csv
